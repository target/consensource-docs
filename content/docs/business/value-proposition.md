    Value delivered by adoption of the ConsenSource platform
---

ConsenSource aims to solve the issue with ongoing maintenance and record keeping of certifications  and audits that are issued to suppliers and vendors of brands and retailers.  Fundamentally shifting the onus of maintenance and upkeep from all of the disparate parties that receive and maintain this information today to a decentralized platform in the future means that producers and consumers of that information will more broadly benefit from the timely and accurate records those certifications are intended to represent.  

The platform is also intended to create additional incentives related to awareness and marketability related to the other personas that are intended to interact and contribute data to the platform.  The platform is intended to benefit and incentivize each persona uniquely and not create disincentives for any given persona ultimately for its adoption and future growth.
