        &lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s ever changing digital environment, companies are continually challenged with keeping accurate records. This ongoing record and data maintenance challenge is true across many facets of business, including keeping accurate records of certifications and audits related to supply chains for products and their raw materials.  Even when these records are being provided via a website or some other electronic mechanism, they generally are not provided with the customer and recipient of those records in mind, making the ability to keep up to date and accurate records difficult, if not impossible. Additionally, every system of record has a different way of providing access, which forces those looking for the information to have a different approach for each source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the often antiquated and outdated way that certification records are provided to others creates an ever increasing challenge and risk to brands and retailers who not only desire and rely on accurate information, but also find this information critically important to their business.  Ultimately, the increasing push for transparency from brands and retailers as well as an increasingly high expectation from consumers is why we believe a change in how this information is captured and shared needs to be made on a broad scale.  ConsenSource aims to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Value Proposition</title>
      <link>https://target.github.io/consensource-docs/docs/business/value-proposition/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;ConsenSource aims to solve the issue with ongoing maintenance and record keeping of certifications  and audits that are issued to suppliers and vendors of brands and retailers.  Fundamentally shifting the onus of maintenance and upkeep from all of the disparate parties that receive and maintain this information today to a decentralized platform in the future means that producers and consumers of that information will more broadly benefit from the timely and accurate records those certifications are intended to represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform is also intended to create additional incentives related to awareness and marketability related to the other personas that are intended to interact and contribute data to the platform.  The platform is intended to benefit and incentivize each persona uniquely and not create disincentives for any given persona ultimately for its adoption and future growth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Overview</title>
      <link>https://target.github.io/consensource-docs/docs/business/dlt-overview/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-blockchain&#34;&gt;What Is A Blockchain?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockchain is a network in which a record of transactions are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network. All nodes in this network reach consensus on what the state of the ledger should look like before adding to it. This enforces a level of  trust and transparency regarding the authenticity and immutability of data within the ledger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchains are a particular type of distributed ledger technology (DLT), and as such, we have elected to use the broader term, DLT, as we further develop ConsenSource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3xGLc-zz9cA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-a-permissioned-blockchain&#34;&gt;What Is A Permissioned Blockchain?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchains can be further subdivided into two categories - &lt;em&gt;permissionless&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;permissioned&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permissionless systems&lt;/strong&gt;, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, allow anybody to join the network. This approach works great in an open environment such as peer-to-peer cash, but it has two main drawbacks - &lt;em&gt;efficiency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a permsionless system it must be assumed that all actors on the network are potentially malicious. This requires a more costly consensus algorithm, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Proof-of-Work&lt;/a&gt;, in order to verify that transactions are authentic. The second drawback is lack of control over which actors are allowed to join the network. For many enterprise use cases, such as ConsenSource, there is a need to limit the network to only relevant actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permissioned systems&lt;/strong&gt; aim to solve these two problems of efficiency and control. ConsenSource uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hyperledger Sawtooth&lt;/a&gt;, an enterprise DLT, to provide an additional layer of security and access control by allowing for &lt;em&gt;on-chain governance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that all members of the network must reach consensus around which new actors are allowed to join the network, the types of actions they can perform, and more. A permissioned DLT lets ConsenSource use a more efficient consensus algorithm (&lt;a href=&#34;test.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;more info here - todo&lt;/a&gt;) because there is a base level of trust between participants in the network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-primary&#34; role=&#34;alert&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;alert-heading&#34;&gt;Takeaway&lt;/h4&gt;
ConsenSource uses a &lt;em&gt;permissioned&lt;/em&gt; DLT to provide both greater efficiency, and control, of the network.
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-use-dlt&#34;&gt;Why Use DLT?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;benefits&#34;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhanced Trust&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a centralized database solution, all parties must trust the owner of the database - in situations with potentially untrusted participants, this is often not practical.
DLT enforces trust by enabling all parties to share an immutable and complete record of all transactions that occur in the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Distributed Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than a single party bearing the burden of maintaing and running a centralized database, DLT allows multiple parties to collaboratively maintain a ledger of transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improved Efficiency&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process of manually reconciling multiple ledgers, between multiple parties, is time consuming, expensive, and error prone. By sharing a single digital ledger, all parties recieve more
accurate data while performing less work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tradeoffs&#34;&gt;Tradeoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blockchain is an emerging technology&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As such, the platforms and tools in the blockchain ecosystem are changing rapidly, and many developers have little experience with the technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Hyperledger Sawtooth&lt;/em&gt; platform supports a wide variety of programming languages for smart contract development, making it easier for new developers to utilize their existing skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reaching consensus is time consuming&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The network much reach consensus regarding the validity of all transactions in the network. This takes time, and is slower than a traditional database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ConsenSource utilizes an efficient consensus algorithm to reduce network latency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiple parties need to run validator node&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The premise of blockchain technology is built around multiple parties running nodes that validate transactions, rather than a single entity managing and maintaining the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This enforces transparency and trust around the validity of all transactions. ConsenSource has &lt;a href=&#34;https://target.github.io/consensource-docs/consensource-docs/docs/developer/getting-started/&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; on running a node in multiple environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
