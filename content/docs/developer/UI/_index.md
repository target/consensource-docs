  Overview of the ConsenSource UI application.
---

The ConsenSource UI is comprised of a number of Mithril applications under the same router. The default application that is served from the _ page is for retailers. To access the other apps, specify the relative .html file in _/public\_ such as [localhost:8080/index_auditor.html](localhost:8080/index_auditor.html).

The documentation below will provide a higher-level overview of the UI/UX interactions that can be performed through the app. Developers who wish to run or contribute to the UI application should view the [project README](https://github.com/target/consensource-ui/tree/master) for more information.
