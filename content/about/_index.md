# About ConsenSource

<br />

The ConsenSource application empowers brands and retailers, factories, certifying bodies and standards bodies to increase transparency and efficiency around the certification process.

For many brands and retailers, a common pain point in the sourcing process is the discovery and verification of the certification claims for a given factory. If a brand or retailer wishes to only do business with factories that have a given certification, where can they find a filtered list of only the factories that are certified? Furthermore, _how can they trust that the certification is valid_?

In practice, each brand and retailer ends up independently verifying these claims with the certifying body that performed the original audit. This process is time-consuming, expensive, and error prone.

# How ConsenSource Can Help

<br />

ConsenSource solves this problem of trust and authenticity within the certification process using _Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)_. The application serves as a common platform to verify and display the certifications and audit data between brands and retailers, factories, certifying bodies, and standards bodies.

DLT allows all partners to share ownership of this data. Each partner is tasked with the duty of owning their data and keeping this information up to date, shifting the onus of data accuracy to the relevant party.
Each participant in the network plays a unique role. 

- **Standards bodies** create standards and accredit certifying bodies. 

- **Certifying bodies** are then able to audit and certify factories against the standards they are accredited for.

- **Factories** are able to request these certifications and in-person audits, so that certifying bodies are able to issue certificates based on in-person, off-chain audit results. 

- **Brands and Retailers** are able to view and trust the resulting data from these interactions as well as general contact and location information on each of these entities.
